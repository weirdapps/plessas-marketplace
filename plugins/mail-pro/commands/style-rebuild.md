## Pre-flight: knowledge store check (MANDATORY)

This command requires the **second-brain knowledge store** — a local SQLite database that ingests your sent/received email. It ships separately from `plessas-marketplace`.

Before doing anything else, run:

```bash
test -f ~/SourceCode/second-brain/data/brain.db && echo "ok" || echo "missing"
```

If the file is **missing**, stop immediately and tell the user verbatim:

> `/style-rebuild` requires the second-brain knowledge store, which is not installed on this machine.
>
> The knowledge store is a local SQLite database that holds your full email corpus, classified and indexed. It ships in the `second-brain` repo, which is **currently a private GitHub repo** under the `weirdapps` organisation.
>
> If you have access to `weirdapps`, install it:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/weirdapps/second-brain.git ~/SourceCode/second-brain
> cd ~/SourceCode/second-brain && cat README.md   # follow the setup steps
> ```
>
> If you do **not** have access, ask the marketplace maintainer to grant it, or skip this command — `/reply` and the rest of the `mail` plugin work without it (just without the corpus-driven style refinement).
>
> Once the database exists at `~/SourceCode/second-brain/data/brain.db`, re-run `/style-rebuild`.

Do NOT attempt to fall back to Outlook, Sent Items, or other data sources — the analysis is statistically meaningful only with the full ingested corpus.

<objective>
Perform a comprehensive corpus analysis of ALL sent emails stored in the knowledge store (SQLite database at `~/SourceCode/second-brain/data/brain.db`) to generate a statistically-grounded style guide with per-recipient profiles.

## Workflow

### 1. Connect to Knowledge Store DB
Open the SQLite database at `~/SourceCode/second-brain/data/brain.db`.

Verify tables exist:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/SourceCode/second-brain/data/brain.db ".tables"
```

**Data source priority:**
1. **Knowledge store DB** (primary) — contains the full email corpus with content, already classified
2. **Archive mailbox** via `mcp__outlook-bridge__outlook_list_mail` (supplementary) — for very recent emails not yet ingested into DB. The user CCs himself on all replies, so sent mail appears in Archive (`folder: "Archive"`); filter client-side to messages where `From.upn` matches the user's UPN.
3. **Sent Items** — NEVER use for historical analysis. The user regularly empties Sent Items. Only useful for emails sent in the last few hours (call `outlook_list_mail` with `folder: "Sent Items"` if ever needed).

### 2. Extract All Sent Emails
Query all emails where the user is the sender (from second-brain DB):
```sql
SELECT e.id, e.date_received, e.sender_name, e.sender_address,
       e.subject, e.summary, e.sentiment, e.language, e.content,
       e.in_reply_to, e.conversation_id
FROM emails e
WHERE e.sender_address LIKE '%<USER_EMAIL>%'
ORDER BY e.date_received DESC;
```

### 3. Map Recipients for Each Sent Email
For each sent email, identify recipients:
```sql
SELECT p.name, p.email, p.role, p.department, ep.role_in_email
FROM email_people ep
JOIN people p ON ep.person_id = p.id
WHERE ep.email_id = ? AND ep.role_in_email IN ('to', 'cc');
```

### 4. Per-Recipient Analysis
For each unique recipient, compute:

| Metric | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Email count** | Total emails sent to this person |
| **Avg reply length** | Mean character/word count of replies |
| **Length distribution** | p10, median, p90 word counts |
| **Language distribution** | % Greek vs English vs mixed |
| **Greeting patterns** | Most common openings (top 3 with frequency) |
| **Closing patterns** | Most common sign-offs (top 3 with frequency) |
| **Tone** | Formal / semi-formal / casual (classify each, report distribution) |
| **Formality score** | 1-5 scale based on vocabulary and structure |
| **Reply speed** | Avg time between received and reply (if conversation threading available) |
| **Time-of-day patterns** | Hour distribution of sent emails to this person |

### 5. Global Style Analysis
Across all sent emails:
- Overall average reply length (mean, median, p10, p90)
- Language split (Greek / English / mixed)
- Most common greeting patterns (with N counts)
- Most common closing patterns (with N counts)
- Vocabulary fingerprint: frequently used phrases, filler words, transition markers
- Escalation markers: phrases used when tone shifts to urgent/directive
- Delegation patterns: how tasks are assigned vs requested

### 6. Identify Style Clusters
Group recipients into style clusters:
- **Formal**: Board, C-suite, external partners
- **Semi-formal**: Peers, cross-department heads
- **Casual**: Direct reports, close colleagues
- **Brief**: Recipients who get terse replies
- **Detailed**: Recipients who get longer, structured replies

### 7. Backup Current Style Guide
Before overwriting, create a timestamped backup:
```bash
TZ='Europe/Athens' date '+%Y%m%d%H%M'
cp plugins/email-handler/shared/style-guide.md \
   ~/.claude/drafts/style-guide-backups/YYYYMMDDHHMM_style-guide.md
```
Create the backups directory if it doesn't exist.

### 8. Generate New Style Guide
Write the rebuilt `shared/style-guide.md` with:
- Statistical backing for every claim (e.g., "Based on N=47 emails to X")
- Per-recipient profiles with evidence counts
- Global defaults with distributions
- Confidence indicators (high/medium/low based on sample size)

### 9. Present Summary Report
```
